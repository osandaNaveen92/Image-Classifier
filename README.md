## Introduction

Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to build an image classifier that can accurately classify skin lesions as benign or malignant.
All the implimentation done by using Jupyter Notebook

## Features

- Utilizes transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- High accuracy in classifying skin lesions
- Easy to use and deploy

## Installation

1.In this project, I have declared all the files separately, and I used Jupyter Notebook to combine all the separate codes to compile and run.
2.Clone the repository and prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

1. Train the model: Before training the model, first import all the libraries used in the libraries file. Then compile the Train & Visualization file to train the model.
2. Evaluate the model:For evaluation,use any of the given different pre-trained models and get the results

## Results 

-I have already uploaded one .ipynb file with all the variance of models.
